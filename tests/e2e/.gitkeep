# End-to-end tests for @agent-memory/core
#
# These tests should:
# - Test full user workflows
# - Use real file system
# - External APIs env-gated (LIVE_TEST=1)
# - Can be slow
#
# Files to create:
# - workflows.test.ts: Complete user scenarios
#   - Full session lifecycle: ingest → search → read
#   - Full memory lifecycle: write → search → read → update → delete
#   - Multi-session search ranking
#   - Large session chunking
